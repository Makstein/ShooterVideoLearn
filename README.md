# ShooterVideoLearn

This is a TPS game demo, developed with Unreal Engine 5,  the main goal of  this project is to test and show what I have learned from some UE video tutorial.

## Features

- Basic third person controller

- Character move/aim/fire/turn animation blend

- Basic pickup system

- Basic ammo system(Use when fire, add when pickup, reload and display on HUD)

## Use Guide

After download and open this project with UE5, you may find some assets are missing, this is because they are too large to use git control, so if you want to run the demo, you may need to download and import the asstes from epic game store manually.

- Paragon: Lt. Belica

- Modular Scifi Season 2 Starter Bundle

All these assetes are free in Epic Games Store, after download and import these assetes to project, is should works fine.
